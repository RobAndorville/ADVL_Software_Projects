# Summary of the Andorville™ Software Projects
Andorville™ applications are small single-purpose programs that are easy to code and modify. They can be connected and coordinated through the Andorville™ Network. "H7" code is used to control each application and communicate between applications. This code stores the machine intelligence of a multi-project application.

***Network***
The Andorville™ Network (previously called the Message Service) uses the Microsoft® Windows® Communication Foundation (WCF) to allow Andorville™ applications to exchange information and interact to perform higher level functions.

***Project Network***
The Project Network Software (previously called the Application Network) is used to create a hierarchy of projects to build a data model. The activity of the project host applications is coordinated to perform processing and analysis of the data model.

***Utilities Library***
The Utilities Class Library contains a set of common classes used by Andorville™ applications. It contains classes to manage projects, compress data, and run XMessage instructions used to communicate between applications.

***Application Template***
The Application Template is a simple example application containing all the software features required for an Andorville™ application.

***Coordinates***
The Coordinates application is used to convert between different geodetic and projected coordinates. It uses the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset. The software uses the Coordinates Class Library.

***Import***
The Import application is used to import data from text files into a database.

***Database Tools***
The Database Tools application is used to create, edit and save a database design and create new databases and tables.

***Chart***
The Chart application displays charts from data stored in database tables.

***Shares***
The Shares application is used to analyse share market data. Separate Access databases are used to store share prices, historical financials and calculated data. The software is being developed to test the performance of different share selection methods.

***Information Library***
The Information Library application stores a collection of related information as nodes in a tree structure. The software allows multiple versions and updates of each information node.

***Well Deviation***
The Well Deviation application calculates the deviation of an oil well from deviation log measurements. The software uses the Coordinates application to calculate the projected coordinates of the well location from the geodetic coordinates. The well path is plotted in plan and vertical section views.

***Regression***
The Regression application provides linear and non-linear regression services to applications connected to the Andorville™ Network. (Update in progress.)

***"H7" Code***
"H7" code consists of a sequence of information/destination pairs that are used to control an Andorville™ application. This code is converted to XML format for Network transmission and for file storage. "H7+" code contains instructions for loops, branches and subroutines and is used to code processing sequences.

***Other Projects in Development:***

The "M7" alternative mathematics system is based in "H7+" but with mathematical instructions added. This system uses only whole numbers and processes to construct mathematical models. Non-integer constants like pi and e are represented by the corresponding processes instead of decimal numbers. "M7" demonstrates the advantages of a simplified mathematical system based on the philosophy of Leopold Kronecker.

"S7" is a general purpose multi-dimensional signal processing system. This is a re-write of an existing system. The new version will be compatible with the Andorville™ Network.

"Q7" is a quantum mechanics modelling system. This system demonstrates the key features of the 3D Wavenumber (3DK) interpretation of quantum mechanics.

The term wavenumber refers to frequency in the distance domain rather than the usual time domain. The more familiar frequency term is used in place of wavenumber in the following summary.

In the 3DK interpretation of quantum mechanics, the universe evolves in the 3D frequency domain. Quantum decoherence is a momentary distance domain image produced when elementary particles interact. This is analogous to an inverse Fourier transform process. Space is an illusion, representing the differences in phase between the waveforms in the frequency domain that form the elementary particles. The apparent quantum mechanics weirdness observed in the distance domain is normal behaviour in the frequency domain.

The universe evolves from moment to moment in the frequency domain. There is an upper frequency limit in this domain that sets the resolution and speed limits in the apparent distance domain.
