The Andorville™ Multi-Cellular Software System

The Andorville™ Multi-Cellular Software System consists of a Message Network, Data Project Network, project management system, data exchange and control formats and a collection of applications and data projects that can be connected to the network.

Each Data Project and associated Application addresses a particular problem domain. Projects can be connected in a tree structure using the Project Network application to extend the problem domain. The multi-cellular architecture allows very large applications to be built while limiting the overall system complexity.
