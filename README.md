# ADVL_Software_Projects


The Andorville™ software projects are a set of small, single purpose applications.
Each application can be used in stand-alone mode and operated manually through a user interface.
They are also designed to be connected to a communications network and operated automatically through the exchange of XML based messages.

Each application connects to a project that contains information, settings, processing sequences and workflows relating to its operation. A connected set of applications and projects can store data, processes and solutions for a broad problem domain.

**The Andorville™ Multi-Cellular Software Development System**

The Andorville™ Experimental Multi-Cellular Software Development System consists of a Message Network, Data Project Network, project management system, data exchange and control formats and a collection of applications and data projects that can be connected to the network.

Each Data Project and associated Application addresses a particular problem domain. Projects can be connected in a tree structure using the Project Network application to extend the problem domain. The multi-cellular architecture allows very large applications to be built while limiting the overall system complexity.

A short video introducting the system can be found here:
